It creates .git so i can
track the files inside that directory
Staging area helps because it works
as a previous view to the real git repository
It helps me adding the same logical change to
different files, make a group and then commit them
It would help me letting me introduces several changes
without the risk of loosing previous advance.
It makes everything more graphic
so i can understand better where is every branch
It helps get back to one road, the master road.
